Suggestions for a NYC visit (sent to a friend in 2015)... 

- One World Observatory (https://oneworldobservatory.com) - The new viewing gallery at the top of One World Trade Center which just opened a week or so ago. We actually had tickets to go up there ourselves last week but the weather was terrible so we bailed on it. The views look awesome though and arguably better than the Empire State or Top of the Rock.
- The High Line (http://www.thehighline.org/) - Really cool walkway running from Meatpacking up to the 30's. Great way to see that side of the city. Meatpacking is really cool for both nightlife and shops.
- The Whitney (http://whitney.org/) - Just opened and crazy architecture.
- Sleep No More (http://www.sleepnomore.com/) - One of the spookiest / trippiest shows I've ever seen and definitely cooler than they cheesy shows on Broadway. They also have a bar at the top of the Mckittrick Hotel http://www.mckittrickhotel.com (where it is the fictitious hotel where it's set) called The Gallow Green which literally just opened too.
- Williamsburg - One of the coolest neighborhoods in Brooklyn and incredibly easy to get to. It's also really easy to overlook Brooklyn but in many ways it's a lot cooler than Manhattan and Williamsburg epitomizes it. Get off at the Bedford Avenue stop on the L Line (grey) and you're right in the thick of it. Tons of uber cool bars, restaurants, shops, etc.
- Le Bain Bar (http://www.standardhotels.com/high-line/food-drink/le-bain) at the top of the Standard Hotel. Note that it can be hard to get in on Friday or Saturday (as the bouncers can be really strict) so to avoid the hassle I'd go on pretty much any other night. Awesome views too!
- Governor's Island (http://govisland.com/) - Off the beaten track a bit and great views of the downtown from it. Also a free ferry running to / fro. They also host a lot of great events there such as this Jazz Festival where everyone dresses up in 20's stuff (a bit like the Great Gatsby): http://www.jazzagelawnparty.com/tickets.html. There's actually one on next week :)
- Brooklyn Bridge (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/infrastructure/brooklyn-bridge.shtml) - Well worth walking across :)
- Shack Shake in Madison Square Park (https://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/) - Amazing burgers / shakes...a lot of people reckon the best in NYC. If the weather is good they queue will be around an hour, although that's part of the "experience" ;)
- East Village and Lower East Side - Two of my favorite neighborhoods (excuse my US spellings haha), particularly for the nightlife.
- La Esquina (http://www.esquinanyc.com/) - Great Mexican food and very trendy bar hidden completely underground so unless you know it's there you'd miss it...often get celebs there. Also may want to book via OpenTable.

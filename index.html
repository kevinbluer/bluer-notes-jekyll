  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome to Bluer Notes</h1>
  <p>A living breathing public notes repository. This is an active project wherein I'm moving notes that logically should be "free" (and are currently hidden) from a variety of sources such as <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, etc. All of which are wonderful repositories in their own ways, but not as free as they could be.</p>
  <p>Here's some examples of the types of things stored within:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/data">Data Science</a></li>
    <li><a href="/bots">Bots</a></li>
    <li><a href="/austin">Austin, TX</a></li>
    <li><a href="/jobs">Job Listings</a></li>
  </ul>

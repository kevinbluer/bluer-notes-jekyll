<div class="home">

  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome to Bluer Notes</h1>
  <p>A living breathing public notes repository. This is an active project wherein I'm moving notes that logically should be "free" (and are currently hidden) from a variety of sources such as [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), etc. All of which are wonderful repositories in their own ways, but not as free as they could be.</p>
  <p>Here's some examples of the types of things stored within:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>[Data Science](/data)</li>
    <li>[Bots](/bots)</li>
    <li>[Austin, TX](/austin)</li>
    <li>[Job Listings](/jobs)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="rss-subscribe">subscribe <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">via RSS</a></p>

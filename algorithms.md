#### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is everyone, until you look you may not realize it. There are many types of sorting algorithms out there.

- Bubble Sort (extremely inefficient / or quadratic time in Big O)
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Comparison Counting Sort

#### Big O Notation

Or algorithmic worst-case scenarios. It's inexact by design and explores the "relationship between the size of the problem and the program's running time" (or a schema for dividing problems into different broad classes).

- O1 (no relation / "Big O of one" or "constant time")
- On (linear)
- On2 (quadratic time or "Big O of n squared)
- O2n ("Big O of 2 to the n" / exponential time)
- Onf ("Big O of n factorial")

# Clairvoyant Algorithms

Or one informed by data from the future :)

- Random
- FIFO (First In First Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)

#### Other

- Random Search
- Hill Climbing

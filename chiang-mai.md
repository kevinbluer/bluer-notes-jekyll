# Chiang Mai

"Chiang Mai is a city in mountainous northern Thailand that dates back to the 1200s. Its Old City area still retains vestiges of walls and moats from its history as a cultural and religious center. Itâ€™s also home to hundreds of elaborate temples, including 14th-century Wat Phra Singh and 15th-century Wat Chedi Luang, adorned with carved serpents."

- [LÃ©on Bottou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Bottou)

#### Neural Nets

- Feed Forward (as it trains, data just flows one way...from the input node to the output node)

### Noteworthy Projects

- [iGAN, "A deep learning software that easily generates images with a few brushstrokes"](https://github.com/junyanz/iGAN)

##### Open AI Universe

Taken from the awesome [sirajology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGYU5t8MO7s):

- Lets you train and test bots in 1000s of games
- Reinforcement learning is the process of trial and error to learn
- If your bot can defeat any env, you solved intelligence

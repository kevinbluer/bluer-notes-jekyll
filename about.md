This is an active project wherein I'm moving notes that logically should be "free" (and are currently burried) from a variety of sources such as <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, etc. All of which are wonderful repositories in their own respective ways, but the content stored within them isn't, by design, as free as it could or should be.
